## How to View Code in Action

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.

## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For instance: `box-test.js`.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.
